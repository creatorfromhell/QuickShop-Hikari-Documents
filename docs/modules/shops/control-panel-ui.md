# Shop Control Panel (GUI)

The Shop Control Panel allows players to manage their shop using a GUI interface instead of chat prompts.

This menu replaces traditional chat-based editing when enabled.

---

## How It Gets Opened

The Control Panel GUI is opened through the Interaction Manager using: `CONTROL_PANEL_UI`
When a player interacts with their shop:

* If `CONTROL_PANEL_UI` is enabled
* And they have permission
* The Control Panel GUI opens automatically

This behavior is handled internally by the Interaction Manager.

## What It Allows

The Control Panel provides direct access to shop management actions, such as:

* Set Price
* Set Amount
* Change Shop Mode (Selling / Buying / Frozen)
* Freeze / Unfreeze
* Toggle Unlimited
* View Inventory
* View History
* Manage Staff
* Transfer Ownership
* Remove Shop

Available components depend on: `config.yml → shop.control-panel`
