# Taxation System

QuickShop includes a taxation system designed to give server owners more flexibility and control over shop-based income.

This system was revamped as of 6.2.0.11+

The new system allows you to:

- Apply tax to shop owners
- Apply tax to buyers
- Apply tax to both
- Use progressive tax brackets
- Customize tax behavior in configuration

This system replaces the legacy tax configuration.

## How It Works

During a transaction:

1. The shop price is calculated.
2. Tax is calculated based on your configuration.
3. Tax is deducted from the configured target(s).
4. Remaining funds are distributed normally.

You can configure:

- Flat percentage tax
- Progressive tax based on player balance
- Tax accounts
- Distribution rules

## Progressive Tax

The new system allows you to tax based on balance brackets.

Example concept:

- 0 – 10,000 balance → 1% tax
- 10,000 – 100,000 → 2% tax
- 100,000+ → 3% tax

This helps prevent extremely wealthy players from dominating the economy.

## Who Pays the Tax?

You can configure whether tax applies to:

- The shop owner
- The buyer
- Both

This gives you flexibility depending on your economy design.

## Configuration

All tax-related settings are located under the `shop-tax` section in `config.yml`.

The current configuration supports both flat-rate and progressive tax systems:

```yaml
shop-tax:
  # Select which tax system to use:
  # basic       = Flat tax rate
  # progressive = Tax rate based on player balance brackets
  type: basic

  # Account name that receives collected tax money.
  # Set to "" to disable depositing (tax may still be deducted).
  account: tax

  # Show tax details in transaction messages.
  show: false

  # Disable taxes for unlimited shops.
  disable-for-unlimited-shop: false

  # Who to apply the tax to, be it the shop or the player interacting with the shop.
  # player = Apply tax to the player who is interacting with the shop.
  # shop = Apply tax to the shop owner.
  # payee = Apply tax to the person receiving the money.
  # both = Apply tax to both the player and the shop owner.
  apply-to: player

  basic:
    # Flat tax rate (decimal format).
    # Example: 0.05 = 5%
    rate: 0.05

  progressive:
    brackets:
      '10000': 0.01
      '50000': 0.02
      '250000': 0.03
      '1000000': 0.05
      '5000000': 0.08
      '-1': 0.12
```

After updating to 6.2.0.11+, review your tax configuration carefully, as the old tax system has been replaced.
