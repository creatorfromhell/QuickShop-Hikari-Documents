## Check if discount code can be applied to specific shop

If code not accepted by target shop, you will also receive a warning message when you click it.

Then discount will applied to your purchase, and your remaining count will be consumed.

*NOTE: If the above additional conditions are not met, the Discount Code will not be applied and you will not get a discount, but at the same time, the Discount Code will not be consumed, and the prompt message will contain the specific reason.*

## Auto Purge Expired Code

An expired discount code will automatically removed while server startup or in 30mins.  
Before expired codes are purged, players who try to use one receive an error saying that it has expired.

## Convert your time

Expired time accepts both Zulu Time format and UNIX Timestamp in seconds format:

The following website can help you convert the time:  
[https://www.unixtimestamp.com/](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)

For Zulu Time (ISO 8601 Extended) format:

```plain
yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ
```

Note that the server time zone is used for calculations during the conversion.
